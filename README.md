# GoogleAttendance
Google Apps Script making use of Advanced Google Services to run a report of all users in an organization who logged in to their G-Suite Account between two times.

This Google Apps Script is created within a Google Sheet, but can be created as a standalone script referencing a sheet or group of sheets. This is a modified version of Google's "Admin SDK Reports Service" example for generating a Login Activity Report found here (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/admin-sdk-reports#generate_login_activity_report).

Please edit and share - this was originally created as an automated backup option for taking remote student learning attendance based on student logins during a time window.
